Chicago Public Schools Local School Council Voting Areas
=================

##### What is this?
A website that allows residents of Chicago to search by address to discover for what schools they can vote for the Local School Council (LSC) and/or run for a Local School Council Community position.

##### What problem does this solve?
For residents that do not have a student in a Chicago Public Schools school, it can be difficult to determine how and where to get involved in Local School Councils. Residents can participate as a community member by voting in Local School Council elections and running for one of two Community seats on a school's LSC. Eligibility is determined by residence. For schools with an attendance area you must live within the attendance area boundaries. For citywide enrollment schools, a "voting district" boundary is used. A resident may be eligible to participate at a neighborhood elementary school, neighborhood high school, and several citywide schools.
